Description: This package takes a list of p-values resulting from the
        simultaneous testing of many hypotheses and estimates their
        q-values. The q-value of a test measures the proportion of
        false positives incurred (called the false discovery rate)
        when that particular test is called significant. A short
        tutorial on q-values and false discovery rates is provided
        with the manual. Various plots are automatically generated,
        allowing one to make sensible significance cut-offs. Several
        mathematical results have recently been shown on the
        conservative accuracy of the estimated q-values from this
        software. The software can be applied to problems in genomics,
        brain imaging, astrophysics, and data mining.
